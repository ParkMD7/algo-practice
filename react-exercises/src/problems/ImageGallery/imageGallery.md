Build a simple image carousel to navigate forward and backwards through a list of fetched images. You can fetch the images from the following URL: https://img.cdn4dd.com/s/managed/interview/tps-dogs/api.json

## Requirements

- Only fetch the images one time.
- Ensure that the next button is disabled for forward navigation if at the end of the list.
- Ensure that the pervious button is disabled for backwards navigation if at the start of the list.
